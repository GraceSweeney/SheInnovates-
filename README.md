PNC PiggyBankers immersive game for children

Our game is designed as a financial learning module
for children in grades 3-6. The module rewards children
for choosing the correct answers by moving the Piggy
closer to the bank. After all questions are answered,
there is an option to retry incorrect questions. 

The game ends when the Piggy reaches the bank and all
questions have been answered correctly.
